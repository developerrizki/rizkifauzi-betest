**ms-rizkifauzi-betest: Node.js Express API**

### Description:
This project is a Node.js Express API developed for microservice user management. It serves as a robust foundation for building RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express framework. The API is designed to handle various HTTP requests, process data, and interact with a database.

### Features:
- **Express Framework**: Utilizes the fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **RESTful Routes**: Implements RESTful routes for handling CRUD operations.
- **Middleware**: Utilizes middleware for authentication, error handling, and request processing.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes comprehensive unit tests for ensuring code reliability and functionality.
- **Database Integration**: Interacts with a database (MongoDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL) for data storage and retrieval.
- **Environment Configuration**: Utilizes environment variables for configuration, ensuring flexibility and security.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for easy expansion and modification.

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/developerrizki/rizkifauzi-betest`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project-directory`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Configuration:
1. Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` in the root directory.
2. Define environment variables such as `PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc.

### Usage:
